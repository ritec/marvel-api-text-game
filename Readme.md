### Marvel API Integration Game

Get yourself a public and private a Key from:  https://developer.marvel.com/documentation/getting_started
Add it to the environment variables in `MarvelApiService` and start playing.

The application can be started by running:
`ruby game.rb` from the terminal within the root of the directory where game.rb is located. Once you run this the game will begin and request user input.

Specs for the main file marvel_challenge.rb can be run like so:
rspec ./spec/marvel_challenge_spec.rb

Thanks!
